 * Component that shows a simplified checkbox without including any kind of "real" checkbox.
 * Meant to be used when the checkbox is purely decorative and a large number of them will be
 * included, such as for the options in a multi-select. Uses no SVGs or complex animations.
 *
 * Note that this component will be completely invisible to screen-reader users. This is *not*
 * interchangeable with <md-checkbox> and should *not* be used if the user would directly interact
 * with the checkbox. The pseudo-checkbox should only be used as an implementation detail of
 * more complex components that appropriately handle selected / checked state.
